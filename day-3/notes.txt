# what I did

-> what are boolens ( <, >, ==, !=)
-> so bool valuse which give false
-> what to write code for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (+, -, *, /)
-> what is floor division (//), how does it work
-> what is modulus (%)
-> what are exponents (**)
-> what are assignment operators
(=) its work is to assign variable a valuse
(==) conditional check/equality check
(+=) Ex. x+=3 # adds and stores x+3 val in x ie 8 (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
-> waht are operators
Python divides the operators in the following groups:
Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators
